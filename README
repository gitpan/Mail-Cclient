DESCRIPTION

Mail::Cclient gives access to mailboxes in many different formats
(including remote IMAP folders) via the c-client API. The c-client
library is the core library used by Pine and the University of
Washington IMAP daemon (written by Mark Crispin).

PREREQUISITES

If you use RedHat please install the following rpm's:

imap-devel-xxx.xxx.rpm
krb5-devel-xxx.xxx.rpm
openssl-devel-xxx.xxx.rpm
pam-devel-xxx.xxx.rpm

INSTALLATION

Minumum instruction

(Gentoo)

# emerge mit-krb5
# emerge uw-imap

perl Makefile.PL \
    --with-shared_cclient \
    --with-kerberos=/usr/lib \
    --with-pam \
    --with-ssl \
    --with-cclient-includes=/usr/include/imap

make
make test
make install

(RedHat 8.0, 9 and Fedora Core 1):

perl Makefile.PL \
    --with-shared_cclient \
    --with-kerberos=/usr/kerberos/lib \
    --with-pam \
    --with-ssl \
    --with-cclient-includes=/usr/include/imap
make
make test
make install

Build static library without OpenSSL

(Gentoo)

tar xvfz Mail-Cclient-1.12.tar.gz
tar xvfz imap-2004a.tar.Z
cd imap-2004a
make slx SSLTYPE=none
(if x86_64-linux - AMD64: make slx SSLTYPE=none EXTRACFLAGS=-fPIC)
cd ../Mail-Cclient-1.12
perl Makefile.PL --cclient_dir=../imap-2004a/c-client --with-pam
make
make test
make install

(RedHat 8.0, 9 and Fedora Core 1):

tar xvfz Mail-Cclient-1.12.tar.gz
tar xvfz imap-2004a.tar.Z
cd imap-2004a
make lrh SSLTYPE=none 
cd ../Mail-Cclient-1.12
perl Makefile.PL --cclient_dir=../imap-2004a/c-client --with-pam
make
make test
make install

A little advanced instruction:

Install the University of Washington imapd source distribution
(e.g. version imap-2004a.tar.Z or above) and build at least the c-client
library (c-client/c-client.a). The home site for the UW imapd is
    ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/imap/imap-2004a.tar.Z

If your platform needs any additional LIBS entries, edit Makefile.PL
and add them. Do

c-client shared library

    perl Makefile.PL --with-shared_cclient
    make
    make test

c-client static library

    perl Makefile.PL --cclient_dir=/path/to/c-client

Options:
    --cclient_dir=/path/to/c-client
    --with-shared_cclient
    --with-pam=/path/to/libs (support for PAM)
    --with-ssl=/path/to/libs (support for SSL)
    --with-kerberos=/path/to/libs (support for Kerberos)
    --with-cclient-includes=/path/to/imap_includes
    --help

where /path/to/c-client is the pathname of the directory which contains
the c-client.a archive library which you have just built. If you want
to add any additional MakeMaker options then edit the file Makefile.PL
and add them in WriteMakefile.

This process needs to extract all object files from the c-client.a
archive into the current directory. This is for the sake of those
platforms which require an explicit list of object files for creating
shared objects rather than a mix of .o and .a files. If the extraction
succeeds, it will say so and you can carry on and do

    make
    make test

If the extraction failed for some reason, you will have to do that
part yourself and then replace that part of MakeMaker with a simple
assignment to @objects of the object files in your c-client.a.

Once the extension has been built, you can do

    make install

to complete the installation.

DOCUMENTATION

Cclient.pm includes fairly complete documentation which the
build/installation process will turn into a man page. You may also
want to read the $CCLIENT_DIR/docs/Internal.doc which documents the
underlying c-client library. However, that documentation is at odds
with the actual code in a few places.
