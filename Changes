1.1
31 Oct 2000

* Added "search" method.

* Fixed documentation to match tightened MIME message/rfc822 check.

* Renamed "t" directory to "examples".

* Added rfc822_date to @EXPORT_OK and documentation.

1.0
10 May 2000

* Make the elt method fill in a flag name of the form "user_flag_%d"
  when a message's flag bitmap has a bit set which does not
  correspond to a name in the stream's user_flags array.

* Tighten check for MIME non-multipart nested messages from message/*
  to message/rfc822.

* Define PERL_POLLUTE so that na and sv_undef are defined for Perl 5.6.

* Bump version to 1.0 since it's been working decently for a couple
  of years without major changes.

0.6
17 Jun 1999

* Added rfc822_date function (without which it's difficult to get
  hold of a date which includes the timezone name)

* Added $body->disposition to get content-disposition information


0.5
7 Jun 1999

* $mc->status method was calling back "log" instead of "status"

* Added documentation on the $mc->open method

* The mailstream2sv HV was caching stale objects and the DESTROY
  method was then causing closes on those stale streams at program
  exit. That led to segfaults. Stale streams are now deleted from the
  hash and the destructor has been removed since there's no nice way
  to keep it clean.

* Added $mc->append method
  (from code submitted by Kevin Sullivan <ksulliva@kludge.psc.edu>)

* Added CAVEATS section to documentation
  (submitted by Bruce Gingery <bgingery@gtcs.com>)

* Attempt to work around possible NULL parts in make_body for TYPEMESSAGE.

  causing fetchheader to return only half the requested headers
